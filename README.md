# Breakout game
Breakout game made with Turtle module (TK Inter) and OOP

I made this game just for testing myself. It was developed using OOP (thatÂ´s why you will need all the files in the same folder). 

Execute the main and have a good time.

Enjoy it !!!!


The second version will include points counter, restart and limited attempts. In addition, the speed will increase on each level... comming soon.
